    <p>The <i>Millennium Falcon</i> is a YT-1300 Corellian freighter that has survived many a battle but is a little the worse for wear. It has played crucial roles in Episodes IV-VIII in defeating the Empire/First Order. It is held together by sealing foam, spacer's glue, and pure dumb luck.
    It was sold to a small shipping company before it passed to Lando Calrissian, a young gambler trying to make his way in the Galaxy. He lost the <i>Falcon</i> in a game of sabacc to Han Solo, a smuggler who used it to transport illegal cargo. He took on a Wookiee named Chewbacca, and the two became fast friends.
    They helped Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 to escape and then destroy the Empire. It then passed through a number of criminals' hands until ending up on a scrap heap on the desert planet of Jakku, where it was revived by Rey and used to defeat the evil First Order.</p>
